# InnoTSR: Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition system with voice feedback command


## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms for accurate traffic sign detection and recognition.
- **Voice Command Alerts**: Built-in instant voice alert to notify the user of detected traffic sign information in real-time.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides a seamless and intuitive experience for advanced traffic sign recognition and alert systems


<!-- ## Requirements

Before running this project, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tensorflow 2.18 or higher
- YOLOv5 model from [YOLOv5 GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- OpenCV for video capturing and processing
- SpeechRecognition for voice command processing
- Pyaudio (optional, depending on your microphone setup)

To install the necessary Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` -->


## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
